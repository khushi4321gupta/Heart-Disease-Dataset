# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Dataset

## 📌 Context

This dataset dates back to **1988** and consists of data collected from **four medical databases**:

- Cleveland
- Hungary
- Switzerland
- Long Beach V

The dataset originally contains **76 attributes**, including the predicted attribute. However, **most published research uses only a subset of 14 key attributes** for building prediction models.

The **target variable** indicates the **presence of heart disease** in a patient and is defined as:

- `0` → No Heart Disease  
- `1` → Presence of Heart Disease  

For privacy reasons, **all patient names and social security numbers have been removed** and replaced with **dummy values**.

## 📂 Dataset Content

Each row in the dataset represents medical information for one patient. The most commonly used **14 attributes** are listed below.

---

## 📑 Attribute Information

| Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **age** | Age of the patient |
| **sex** | Sex (1 = male, 0 = female) |
| **chest pain type** | Type of chest pain (4 values) |
| **resting blood pressure** | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) |
| **serum cholestoral** | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl |
| **fasting blood sugar** | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) |
| **resting ECG results** | Resting electrocardiographic results (0,1,2) |
| **maximum heart rate achieved** | Maximum heart rate during test |
| **exercise induced angina** | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) |
| **oldpeak** | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| **slope** | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| **number of major vessels** | Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| **thal** | 0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect |
| **target** | 0 = no disease, 1 = disease |
